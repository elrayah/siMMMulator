## FAQ

We will be updating this section with more FAQs.

**Does siMMMulator keep my data?**

No, it is just a code package, no data is uploaded anywhere. You can use siMMMulator even without internet.

**Can the data generated on siMMMulator be used on any MMM?**

Yes! siMMMulator is just a way to generate a data frame, you can use that data with any MMM. If you don't have an MMM already built, we recommend looking at [Robyn](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/), an open source MMM also developed by Meta Open Source.

**How do I pick inputs for my functions?**

See our Step-by-Step Guide for some recommendations. However, use your best judgment on your business and the business environment to determine inputs that are relevant for you.

**How do I know if my data set is realistic?**

This is a difficult question because what is "realistic" is different depending on the type of business. One good way to check if your data is "realistic" for your business is if it roughly matches your historical data or data in the industry.
